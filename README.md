Xorcery, a boostrap like library designed to help you grow your solution and helping the developers with common service design features, such as REST API clients and servers, as well as reactive streaming of data in a way that doesn't suck.

## Installation


Run mvn install to compile everything

## Usage
The Neo4j service is not yet updated for JDK18 so a few JVM options need to be added.

```bash
java --add-exports=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports=jdk.unsupported/sun.misc=ALL-UNNAMED -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath "<classpath>" com.exoreaction.xorcery.server.Main -id=server1
```

Add these to the IntelliJ JVM options tab if you are starting Main from within that environment.
On IntelliJ >2021.3.2: "Open 'Edit/run configurations' dialog" -> "Edit Configurations" -> "Choose run configuration for Application" -> under "Build and run" -> "Modify options" -> "Add VM options" -> Enter all options starting with "--add-...." 

You can also use mvn exec:exec to run it with the correct settings.
Alterative in intelliJ, which can run on IntelliJ-downloaded/confed JVM: "Maven" tab on the right hand side -> "manager" -> Plugins -> "exec" -> "exec:exec"
