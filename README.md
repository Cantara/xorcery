Xorcery, a boostrap like library designed to help you grow your solution and helping the developers with common service design features, such as REST API clients and servers, as well as reactive streaming of data in a way that doesn't suck.

## Installation

Run mvn install to compile everything.

## JVM version requirement
Xorcery has been designed with Java 17 features, so use that or newer in your own projects.

## Adding Xorcery to your project

To add Xorcery to your own project, you can use the following Maven BOM artifact. After that you can refer to the individual modules without specifying versions explicitly.
